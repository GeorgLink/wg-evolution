# Hints to help decide suitability for maintenership position

## Description

In some cases, projects need to evaluate and decide whether a person
should be offered commit access or whatever the equivalent is
for the kind of work they're doing
(e.g., maybe it's actually "a vote on the steering committee" or
"an editorship position in the documentation" or whatever).

The point is, existing maintainers often find themselves evaluating
a person's activity in order to determine whether that person
should be invited into some kind of formal maintainer role.
    
## Main goal

An ability to look at a list of participants in a project,
and see what they've been up to that could be interesting
towards offering them a mainteinership position.

## Vocabulary

Maintenership position: some position in a project with involves
responsibilities as maintainer, such as having commit access to the
main branches of the project, vote on the steering committee of the
project, or editorship position in the documentation, for example.

Mainteiners: People already in a maintership position.

Developers: People controbuting to a project.

## Primary actor

Maintainers of a project, or in generl, people deciding who to invite
as a mantainer.

## Stakeholders

List of stakeholders, usually including the primary actor,
and the reason why they have a stake in the use case.

* Maintainers: to have information about potential developers
  to invite to mainternership positions.
* Developers: to have an idea of the kind of activity and other
  characteristics that they have, in relationship with what
  is expected for being invited to maintership positions.

## Preconditions

A project with a path to mainteinership, where developers
are invited to maintership based, at least in part,
on their past activity in, and relationship with the project.

## Questions

* Activity: How much activity in the project had this person in the past?

## Metrics

[ Still to be defined ]

Metrics useful in this scenario.
Each metric will have an identifier (which will be a link
to the document with more details on the metric), and a short
description of the metric, and which questions it helps to answer.

* MId1: Description of Metric 1 (QuestionId, QuestionId...)
* MId2: Description of Metric 2 (QuestionId, QuestionId...)
* ...

## Comments

[None for now ]

Any other relevant comment. For example, specific threasholds for metrics could be provided, such as "if XXX metric reaches YYY value, the benefits for the project are clear".
